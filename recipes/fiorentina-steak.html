      <h3>
        Italian steak made of young steer (vitellone) or heifer (scottona) that,
        combined with the specific preparation, makes it one of the most popular
        dishes of Tuscan cuisine.
      </h3>
      <p class="description">
        The Florentine steak is obtained from the cut of the sirloin (the part
        corresponding to the lumbar vertebrae, the half of the back on the side
        of the tail) of the calf of the Chianina breed: in the middle it has the
        "T" shaped bone, in fact it is also called T-bone steak, with the fillet
        on one side and the sirloin on the other.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) choice or prime porterhouse steak</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Tuscan olive oil</li>
        <li>Moist, grey sea salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 lemon wedges</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Press chopped rosemary onto both sides of porterhouse steak; set onto
          a plate and allow to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start an outdoor grill using hardwood charcoal, such as hickory. When
          coals are white and glowing, arrange for high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently brush or rub olive oil onto steak, then season to taste with
          sea salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place steak onto grill, and cook until a dark, golden brown (not
          burnt) crust forms, 5 to 10 minutes depending on thickness of meat.
          Turn over, and continue cooking until golden on the other side, 5 to
          10 minutes more. When finished, place steak onto a platter, and allow
          to rest for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          To serve, remove the two pieces of meat from the bone, and replace the
          bone onto the serving platter. Trim any unwanted fat from the round
          (tenderloin) steak, slice into 6 equal pieces at an angle to the
          grain, and fan out on one side of the bone. Slice the rectangular
          (loin) steak into 1/4-inch slices at an angle to the grain. Fan out on
          the other side of the bone. Finish by garnishing the platter with
          lemon wedges and a sprinkle of additional sea salt.
        </li>
      </ol>
