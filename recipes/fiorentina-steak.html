    <h3>Italian steak made of young steer (vitellone) or heifer (scottona) that, combined with the specific preparation, makes it one of the most popular dishes of Tuscan cuisine.</h3>
    <p>
        The Florentine steak is obtained from the cut of the sirloin (the part corresponding to the lumbar vertebrae, the half of the back on the side of the tail) of the calf of the Chianina breed: in the middle it has the "T" shaped bone, in fact it is also called T-bone steak, with the fillet on one side and the sirloin on the other.

    <p>
        The italian gastronomist Pellegrino Artusi, in his 1891 cooking manual Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well (La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene), defines the cut of the steak as follows: "Florentine steak. From beef-steak, an English word that is worth the rib of an ox, came the name of our steak, which is nothing more than a chop with its bone, a finger or a finger and a half thick, cut from the sirloin of steer".

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) choice or prime porterhouse steak</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Tuscan olive oil</li>
        <li>Moist, grey sea salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Press chopped rosemary onto both sides of porterhouse steak; set onto a plate and allow to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Start an outdoor grill using hardwood charcoal, such as hickory. When coals are white and glowing, arrange for high heat.</li>
        <li>Gently brush or rub olive oil onto steak, then season to taste with sea salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place steak onto grill, and cook until a dark, golden brown (not burnt) crust forms, 5 to 10 minutes depending on thickness of meat. Turn over, and continue cooking until golden on the other side, 5 to 10 minutes more. When finished, place steak onto a platter, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, remove the two pieces of meat from the bone, and replace the bone onto the serving platter. Trim any unwanted fat from the round (tenderloin) steak, slice into 6 equal pieces at an angle to the grain, and fan out on one side of the bone. Slice the rectangular (loin) steak into 1/4-inch slices at an angle to the grain. Fan out on the other side of the bone. Finish by garnishing the platter with lemon wedges and a sprinkle of additional sea salt.</li>
    </ol>
