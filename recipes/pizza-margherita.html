    <h3>
        Typical Neapolitan pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt, and extra-virgin
        olive oil
    </h3>
    <p>
        A widespread belief says that in June 1889 the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito, Pizzeria Brandi's chef, invented a
        dish called "Pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, and the Italian unification,
        since toppings are tomato (red), mozzarella (white) and basil (green), ingredients inspired by the colors of the
        national flag of Italy.

    <p>
        While the name Pizza Margherita may have been popularized because of the Queen's visit, a pizza made with the
        same toppings was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810.[2] In 1830, in the book Napoli, contorni e
        dintorni, written by Riccio, it was described as a pizza with tomato, mozzarella and basil.[3] In 1849 Emanuele
        Rocco recorded different pizza toppings like basil, tomatoes and thin slices of mozzarella;[4] the mozzarella
        was thinly sliced, and arranged with a flower-shape over the tomato sauce, along with the basil leaves: this may
        be the real origin of the name Margherita (meaning daisy).

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour for dusting</li>
        <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
        <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
        <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
